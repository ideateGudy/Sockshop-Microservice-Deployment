# Overview:

## A microservices-based architecture application is deployed on Kubernetes and thereâ€™s a need to create a clear IaaC (Infrastructure as Code) deployment to be able to deploy the services in a fast manner.

# Setup Details:

- Provision the Socks Shop example microservice application -
- https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/tree/master

# Task Instructions:

- All deliverables need to be deployed using an Infrastructure as Code approach.
- In your solution please emphasize readability and maintainability (make yor application deployment clear)
- We expect a clear way to recreate your setup and will evaluate the project decisions based on:

> Deploy pipeline
>
> Metrics (Alertmanager)
>
> Monitoring (Grafana)
>
> Logging (Prometheus)
>
> - Use Prometheus as a monitoring tool
> - Use Ansible or Terraform as the configuration management tool.
> - You can use an IaaS provider of your choice.
> - The application should run on Kubernetes
